# Lorenzo's Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

A study guide that I can compile my notes about HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript, etc. My motivation to make this study guide was to get a feel for what kinds of material I would be learning in the upcoming course. It's nice to have a study guide such as this one because I can constantly use my coding knowledge to update and improve my study guide while organizing my thoughts and notes about the learning materal. So far, I learned some coding basics and how to have a developer mentality/mindset.
